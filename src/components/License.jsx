        our accredited businesses; the organization does not have any
        negative records with us;the benefit to us from the visibility of
        the hyperlink compensates the absence of Felitechnology; and 
        the link is in the context of general resource information. These
        organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: is not
        in any way deceptive;  does not falsely imply sponsorship,
